Ferris Wheel Movement info

“Motor” / “Bearing” in the centre of the wheel. 
Capsules/ passenger cabins maintain orientation regardless of position in space
Cabins “bob” subtly when moving  from point to point in space as though momentarily maintaining inertia
Points on ferris wheel created by subdividing based on number of cabins  
(x − a)2 + (y − b)2 = r2 For use in calculating the position of each cabin in vertical space
May need to replace specific axes where applicable

Twister Movement Info
Seating rotates counter to main central movement.
Note centripetal forces causing differences in speed inward and outwards
